# 3D_CARPAL_ALIGNMENT_PIPELINE

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook and Python functions required for the following manuscript:

**Saini, J., Ritchie, B., Hasselaar, C., White, N.J., Roach, K.E., Manske, S.L. ** Three-Dimensional Morphology-Based Approaches for Measuring Dorsal Scaphoid Translation. Submitted to the Journal of Orthopaedic Research (February 2026)

The main Jupyter notebook and required Python functions are provided in the `python-files` folder. Sample meshes of two healthy controls and two participants with SLIL injury are provided in the `sample-meshes` folder. 

Techniques for the following carpal alignment measurements are provided in this pipeline:
- **Scapholunate Angle**
- **Radioscaphoid Angle**
- **Radiolunate Angle**
- **Radiocapitate Angle**
- **Capitate-MC3 Angle**
- **Capitolunate Angle**
- **Capitate-Radius Index**
- **Scapholunate Intervals (Proximal, Palmar, Distal, Dorsal, and Central)**
- **Dorsal Scaphoid Translation Technique 1: Dorsal Tangential Line (DTL) Method**
- **Dorsal Scaphoid Translation Technique 2: Posterior Radioscaphoid Angle (PRSA) Method**
